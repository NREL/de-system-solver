This is a proof-of-concept Rust crate that will attempt to demonstrate that the macro system allows for component-by-component building of a system which can be solved by a variety of solver options.  Once it's working well, it'll likely become a dependency for numerous other projects.  

# Cool things already implemented
- `HistoryMethods` derive macro for generating widely usable method
- Solver and System are modular and independent
